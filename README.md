# Giphy_API

### Overview

The goal of this assignment was to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs. The website calls the GIPHY API and uses JavaScript and jQuery to make HTML changes. The styling is made with Bootstrap and CSS.


### Things to Note

1. There are a few sample buttons displayed on the page. In this case the buttons are related to "Dog Breeds"

2. When clicking on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

4. When clicking one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate, clicking on the gif again, it should stop playing.

5. There is a search box where users can enter any other breed and create new buttons
